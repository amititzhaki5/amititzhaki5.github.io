                <p>Hi, my name is Amit Itzhaki and I'm a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in general business. I'll be graduating in May 2024.</p>
                <p>Some of my interests include traveling, working out, reading, and cooking. I love to travel more than anything, and I'm very lucky to have visited so many places around the world. Some of my favorite places I have been to are Spain, Greece, Portugal, the Netherlands, Israel, and London. During the spring 2023 semester I did a study abroad program and lived in Madrid for five months. I also love working out and especially enjoy going on walks and hikes. A great hike I recently did was Lion's Head in Cape Town, South Africa. I enjoy cooking, and I like to meal prep at the beginning of the week to save time throughout the busy week.</p>
                <p>After graduating in May, I plan to move to Los Angeles for work. I'm excited to live in a new place and start my first full time job. I've moved around a lot in my life so I've never been afraid to go somewhere new. While I'm there, I hope to adopt a french bulldog. I'm a huge lover of french bulldogs, and cannot wait to have my own when I finish school.</p>

                    <h2>Travel Planning Application</h2>
                    <p>Designed and deployed an Android application that creates a travel itinerary for a user based on their destination, travel dates, and length of stay. </p>
                    <p>The application generates a curated list of activites to do and places to visit in the city that the user is traveling to. The app has an embedded Google Maps features that allows the user to see the location of the city they are visiting, as well as the location of each place listed on the itinerary. The app also has a feature that allows the user to send the itinerary to themselves via email.</p>

                    <h2>AI De-Duplication</h2>
                    <p>Rearched and tested large language models to determine how they could be used in the detection of duplicate code within large code bases. </p>
                    <p>The research was mainly conducted using Hugging Face, an online platform for the AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) community. Hugging Face features a runtime environment that allows users to test models right on their site. My research mainly consisted of testing different models and focusing on the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of responses from the models. The motive for this research was to determine if AI models could be used for a task such as the de-deuplication of code. De-duplication is necessary for both increase code efficiency and maximum storage availability.</p>

                    <h2>Ping Pong Game</h2>
                    <p>Designed and deployed an Android application that resembles the game of ping pong.</p>
                    <p>The application begins with a stationary ball positioned at the top of the screen, and a paddle at the bottom. The user can drag their finger across the screen to move the paddle left or right. Once the user touches the screen, the ball falls and the user must hit it with the paddle. If the user strikes the ball, a sound plays and the ball bounces off the paddle. The ball will then hit one of the walls and eventually come back down. Then, the user will have to hit the ball again. If the user misses the ball, the game is over. The app keeps track of how many times the user hits the ball and stores the user's highest score. If the user closes and reopens the app, their high score will not be lost.</p>
